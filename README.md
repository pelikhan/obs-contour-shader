# obs_contour_shader

Shader that adds a contour to non-alpha screen section.


This is a [obs-shader-filter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-shaderfilter.1736/) compatible shader.

It adds a contour line around the non-alpha screen section. 
Works great to add a contour after a chroma background removal filter.
